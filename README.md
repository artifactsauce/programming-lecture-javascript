Sample code set for the university lecture
===============

This is a sample code set which is used in the university lecture. The target of the lecture is the students who have never learned programming so far, and will not learn.

The codes are written by HTML and Javascript because Javascript is the only one programming environment which is ensure installed on a Windows computer in university computer suite. We can not install any programs to the computers.

The codes include partially Japanese and are written by shift_jis encoding.
