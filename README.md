Sample code set for the university lecture
===============

This is a sample code set which was used in the university lecture. The target of the lecture is the students who have never learned programming so far, and will not learn.

The codes are written by HTML and Javascript because Javascript is the only one programming environment which is ensure installed on a Windows computer in university computer suite. We can not install any software to the computers for the lecture.

The codes include partially Japanese language, and are written by shift_jis encoding.
